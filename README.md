# DECISION TREE & RANDOM FOREST

Decision trees and ensemble methods, such as Random Forest, are among the most commonly used classification
algorithms in machine learning. Their popularity lies in their ease of decision making interpretability, ability to work with heterogeneous data, and high accuracy in practice.
This paper focuses on the task of classifying ticket price categories based on input data such as ticket type, number of transfers, time to departure, and other relevant attributes. The
main objective was to develop and implement custom versions of the decision tree and Random Forest method without using predefined library models.

The paper provides a detailed description of decision tree theory, entropy and information gain computation, as well as the bagging method that forms the basis of the Random Forest
algorithm. After processing the dataset, the models were trained on the categorical data and their performance was evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix analysis. The results show
that the ensemble Random Forest approach achieves higher accuracy compared to a single decision tree, confirming its advantages in classification tasks with heterogeneous data.
